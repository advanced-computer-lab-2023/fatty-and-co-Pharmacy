// on why we use ...state instead of just {user: action.payload}
// The authReducer function is used to manage the state of the user in the application.
// It uses the spread operator (...state) to create a new state object instead of mutating the existing one.
// This is important because React's re-rendering of components is based on changes in state.
// If we mutate the state directly, React may not recognize that a change has occurred, and therefore may not re-render the component.
