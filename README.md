# Friday's Pharmacy

This project is a virtual pharmacy website for remotely ordering and managing prescriptions.

<img src="./frontend/src/assets/img/GomaaLogo.gif" width="200">

## Motivation

The motivation behind the Friday's Pharmacy project is to provide a seamless and efficient way for patients to manage their prescriptions remotely. In the era of digital transformation, healthcare should not be left behind. This project aims to bring convenience to patients, allowing them to order and manage their prescriptions without the need to travel. This would be especially beneficial in case the global situation requires social distancing once again. Furthermore, it provides a streamlined platform for pharmacists to manage orders and consult with patients, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.

## Build Status

- Project is in development stage
- Unit tests are needed
- UI and UX need to be improved in several areas such as ordering a prescription
  [include all missing or broken requirements here]

## Code Style

This project adheres to certain coding conventions for consistency and readability. Here are some of the key points:

- **Indentation:** We use 2 spaces for indentation. No tabs are allowed.
- **Semicolons:** Every statement should be ended with a semicolon.
- **Quotes:** Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
- **Naming Convention:** We use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for component/class names.
- **Braces:** Opening braces go on the same line as the statement.
- **Variable Declaration:** Always use `let` or `const` to declare variables. Don't use `var`.

We use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to make sure formatting is proper so make sure to use it when writing code.

### Design Pattern

The project follows the MVC design pattern ,MVC is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user , So the Files in the backend was divided into the M (models) where the schema of the models exist which represent the core of the database , the C (controller) where the functions needed for the routes exists and the V (views) the view in MERN stack is represented by the react frontend server.

## Code Examples

1. **Starting the server (backend/src/server.js):**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

2. **API Paths (frontend/src/API/api_paths.js):**

```javascript
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/";
const PACKAGE_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/package/";
const PHARMACIST_BASE = "http://localhost:8000/pharmacist/";
// ... more paths ...

export const API_PATHS = {
  // Guest
  pharmSignUp: `${GUEST_BASE}addRequest/`,
  updateEmail: `${GUEST_BASE}updateEmail/`,
  // ... more paths ...
};
```

3. **Custom Login Hook:**

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
import { API_PATHS } from "API/api_paths";
import { useState } from "react";
import { useAuthContext } from "./useAuthContext";

export const useLogin = () => {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const { dispatch } = useAuthContext();

  const login = async (username, password) => {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const res = await axios.post(API_PATHS.login, {
        Username: username,
        Password: password,
      });
      const json = JSON.stringify(res.data);
      localStorage.setItem("LocalStorageItemNameHere", json);
      dispatch({ type: "LOGIN", payload: res.data });
      setLoading(false);
      return res;
    } catch (err) {
      setLoading(false);
      setError(err.response.data.message);
      return err.response;
    }
  };

  return { login, error, loading };
};
```

4. **Adding a medicine to cart**

```javascript
const patientModel = require("../models/patients");
const orderModel = require("../models/orders");
const cartModel = require("../models/cart");
const medicineModel = require("../models/medicine");
const prescriptionModel = require("../models/prescriptions");

const addMedicineToCart = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const Username = req.user.Username;
    const MedicineID = req.query.Medicine;
    const medicine = await medicineModel.findById(MedicineID);
    if (!medicine) {
      res.status(400).send({ message: "Medicine not found" });
      return;
    }

    // Check if the medicine is prescribed
    const prescribed = await checkPrescription(MedicineID, Username);
    if (!prescribed) {
      res.status(400).send({ message: "Medicine not prescribed" });
      return;
    }

    const cart = await cartModel.findOne({ PatientUsername: Username });

    // Check availablity of the medicine.
    let inCart = 0;
    cart.Medicine.forEach((medicineId) => {
      if (medicineId == MedicineID) {
        inCart++;
      }
    });
    if (medicine.Quantity <= inCart) {
      res.status(400).send({
        message: `Sorry, we only have ${medicine.Quantity} of ${medicine.Name} in stock.`,
      });
      return;
    }
    if (!cart) {
      res.status(400).send({ message: "Cart not found" });
      return;
    }
    cart.TotalCost += medicine.Price;
    cart.Medicine.push(MedicineID);
    await cart.save();
    res.status(200).send(cart);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(400).send({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/advanced-computer-lab-2023/fatty-and-co-Pharmacy
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd fatty-and-co-Pharmacy
```

3. Install the dependencies:

For the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

For the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file in /backend

`MONGO_URI`
This is the URI for your MongoDB database. It should be in the format: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

`JWT_SECRET`
This is the secret key used for signing and verifying JWT tokens for user authentication.

`STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY`
This is your private key for the Stripe API for handling payments. You can obtain this key from your Stripe dashboard.

`PORT`
This is the port number on which your backend server will run. If not specified, it will default to 7000. If changed you will also need to change the API_Paths in frontend/API

Create a `.env` file in the root of your backend directory and insert your key/value pairs in the following format of `KEY=VALUE`:

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_stripe_private_key
PORT=your_port_number
```

## API Reference

Refer to all the API routes in [this file](API_REFERENCE.md)

## Tests

To run jest tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```

The api routes were tested using postman , Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

    GET: Obtain information
    POST: Add information
    PUT: Replace information
    PATCH: Update certain information
    DELETE: Delete information

And we tested the behaviour of our routes and if they produce the correct status code and response according to our project flow .

Many testing routes were created to test the various API endpoints through postman. You can find these in [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)

## How To Use

1. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd fatty-and-co-Pharmacy
```

2. Start the backend server

```bash
cd backend/src
nodemon server
```

3. Open a new terminal and start the frontend server

```bash
cd ../../frontend
npm start
```

Now, both the frontend and backend servers should be running. You can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:4000.
